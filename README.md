## What does it do?

The program will take the file `firstFilterRepositories.json` (which was created using Google BigQuery, by running the query in the `googleBigQueryFirstFilter.sql` file) and output the `reposWithStars.json` file which will contain the ids and urls of all repositories that have more than a certain number of stars. 

### Repository JSON structure

Al repositores in JSON files are decribed by the following structure

```
  {
      "type" : "repository",
      "created_repo_id" : 95419861,
      "created_repo_name" : "paragonie/chronicle",
      "created_repo_url" : "/repos/paragonie/chronicle"
    }
```

```
{
 "makeAuthenticatedRequests` specifies":true,
